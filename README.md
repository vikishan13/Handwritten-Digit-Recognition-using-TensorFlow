# Convolutional Neural Network for MNIST Classification

## Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model architecture consists of convolutional and dense layers, and it is trained using the Adam optimizer with Sparse Categorical Crossentropy as the loss function.

## Project Structure

- **mnist_cnn.py**: Python script containing the code for loading, preprocessing, building, and training the CNN model.
- **README.md**: Documentation and information about the project.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies for the project.

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the `mnist_cnn.py` script to train and evaluate the CNN model.

## Model Architecture

The CNN architecture consists of the following layers:

1. **Conv2D (32 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation)**: Convolutional layer to extract features from the input image.
2. **MaxPooling2D (2x2)**: Max pooling layer to downsample the spatial dimensions.
3. **Conv2D (64 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation)**: Another convolutional layer to capture more complex features.
4. **MaxPooling2D (2x2)**: Another max pooling layer for further downsampling.
5. **Conv2D (64 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation)**: Additional convolutional layer.
6. **Flatten**: Flatten layer to convert the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.
7. **Dense (64 units, ReLU activation)**: Fully connected layer with ReLU activation.
8. **Dense (10 units, Linear activation)**: Output layer with linear activation for logits.

## Loss Function: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy

The chosen loss function for this project is Sparse Categorical Crossentropy, suitable for multi-class classification problems. It measures the difference between the predicted class probabilities and the true class labels. The formula for the loss is as follows:

\[ \text{Loss} = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{C} \text{y}_{ij} \cdot \log(\text{p}_{ij}) \]

Where:
- \( N \) is the number of samples.
- \( C \) is the number of classes.
- \( \text{y}_{ij} \) is 1 if the sample \( i \) belongs to class \( j \), 0 otherwise.
- \( \text{p}_{ij} \) is the predicted probability that sample \( i \) belongs to class \( j \).

## Training and Testing

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01. The training process involves minimizing the Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss. After training for 5 epochs with a batch size of 64, the model is evaluated on the test set, and the accuracy is printed.

## Results

The final test accuracy achieved by the model is displayed at the end of the script execution.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and datasets.
